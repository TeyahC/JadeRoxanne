      <h2>Music & Wellbeing</h2>
      <h3><b>🎵 Welcome</b></h3>
      <p>
        Music has a wonderful way of reaching people - it can spark a memory,
        lift a mood, or help someone feel truly seen and heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m <b>Jade Roxanne</b>, a professional singer with over ten years’
        experience performing across the UK and abroad. Through
        <i>Jade Roxanne Music & Wellbeing</i>, I bring live music and meaningful
        moments to <b>care homes, day centres, and community groups</b> -
        combining professional entertainment with a gentle, person-centred
        approach that supports emotional wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s a lively sing-along, a themed performance, or a quiet
        one-to-one visit, every session is designed to bring joy and connection
        through music.
      </p>

      <h2>💜 About Jade</h2>
      <p>
        Before starting my wellbeing work, I spent time as an
        <b>Activities Coordinator</b>, so I understand the routines, challenges,
        and rewards of daily life in care homes. That experience - along with my
        years as a touring professional singer - inspired me to create sessions
        that are both <b>high-quality performances</b> and
        <b>deeply therapeutic experiences</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve had the privilege of seeing first-hand how music can reach people
        living with dementia — awakening memories, encouraging communication,
        and helping them reconnect with their surroundings and loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also hold a <b>Level 5 Higher Education Diploma in Psychology</b>,
        which gives me a strong understanding of how music impacts mood,
        cognition, and emotional wellbeing.

          “Our residents absolutely loved the ABBA Memories show — everyone was

      <h2>🌷 One-to-One Music Sessions</h2>
      <h3><b>Gentle, personal and deeply meaningful.</b></h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone feels comfortable joining group activities. For those who
        prefer something quieter, I offer one-to-one music visits - calm and
        personalised sessions designed to bring comfort and connection to
        residents who may not leave their rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every person is unique, so I take time to learn about their favourite
        songs, special memories, and what helps them feel relaxed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, a familiar tune can encourage singing, eye contact, or even a
        smile - moments that mean the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sessions are particularly beneficial for: <br />
        • Residents living with dementia or communication difficulties <br />
        • Individuals who prefer one-to-one interaction <br />
        • Those in palliative or end-of-life care

          Jade brings such warmth, energy, and compassion into every visit. Her
          one-to-one room sessions are especially valuable for our residents who
