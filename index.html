        Music has a wonderful way of reaching people - it can spark a memory,
        lift a mood, or help someone feel truly seen and heard.

        I’m <b>Jade Roxanne</b>, a professional singer with over ten years’
        experience performing across the UK and abroad. Through
        <i>Jade Roxanne Music & Wellbeing</i>, I offer live singing and music wellbeing sessions for care homes, day centres and community groups across Kent and East Sussex.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work combines high-quality live music with a gentle, person-centred approach that supports emotional wellbeing. Whether it’s a lively sing-along, a themed performance, or a quiet one-to-one visit, every session is carefully tailored to bring comfort, joy and connection through familiar songs.

      <h2>💜 About Jade</h2>
      <p>
       Before focusing on music and wellbeing, I worked as an <b>Activities Coordinator</b>, giving me a strong understanding of daily life in care homes and the importance of meaningful, inclusive activities. Alongside this, I continue to work as a touring professional singer, bringing confidence, warmth and reliability to every session.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve seen first-hand how music can support people living with dementia - helping to awaken memories, encourage communication and create moments of calm and connection
      </p>
      <p>
        I also hold a <b>Level 5 Higher Education Diploma in Psychology</b>,
         which supports my understanding of how music can positively influence mood, cognition and emotional wellbeing within care settings.

        <h2>🌷 One-to-One Music Sessions</h2>

        </div>

        <h3><b>Gentle, personal and deeply meaningful.</b></h3>
        <p>
          Not everyone feels comfortable joining group activities. For those who
          prefer something quieter, I offer one-to-one music visits - calm and
          personalised sessions designed to bring comfort and connection to
          residents who may not leave their rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every person is unique, so I take time to learn about their favourite
          songs, special memories, and what helps them feel relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, a familiar tune can encourage singing, eye contact, or even a
          smile - moments that mean the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          These sessions are particularly beneficial for: <br />
          • Residents living with dementia or communication difficulties <br />
          • Individuals who prefer one-to-one interaction <br />
          • Those in palliative or end-of-life care

        <p>
           “We can't speak highly enough of Jade Roxanne Music and Wellbeing.
          Jade brings such warmth, energy, and compassion into every visit. Her
            one-to-one room sessions are especially valuable for our residents who
            aren't able to join group activities — she takes the time to really
            connect with each person, making them feel seen, heard, and uplifted
            through music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her sessions create a calm and joyful atmosphere, and we see such
            positive effects on our residents' mood and wellbeing afterwards. Jade
            truly tailors her approach to meet individual needs, and her kindness
            shines through in everything she does.
